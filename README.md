This is a first try on Taggle.
I try a simple task on Taggle called Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster and the website is https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
Since the data is tabular, I choose XGB for the classification prediction.

predict_simple_use_xgb:
simply using xgb without cross validation and some of the features
the public score is : 0.76076

predict_simple_use_xgb_with_most_features:
simply using xgb without cross validation and add features: Cabin and Embarked and ticket
the public score is : 0.78468

This is a quite simple task and the training set is not large, so I try to use a simple decision tree to solve it. Just practice my coding ability.
